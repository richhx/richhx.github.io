<p class="message">
  Hi. I'm Richard, a normal guy who does normal things. <br>
  I graduated from Los Gatos High School in 2014 and am currently attending
  the University of California, San Diego pursuing a B.S. Computer Science.
  I will be using this website to potentially write about my thoughts and
  ideas in a blog, host my resume, and post my ongoing projects. Feel free
  to check me out.
