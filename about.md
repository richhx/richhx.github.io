Hi. I'm Richard, a normal guy who does normal things. <br> <br>
I graduated from Los Gatos High School in 2014 and am currently attending
the University of California, San Diego pursuing a B.S. Computer Science.
I will be using this website to potentially write about my thoughts and
ideas in a blog, host my resume, and post my ongoing projects. Feel free
to check me out. <br> <br>

This site was built using Jekyll and Poole. Poole is an open-sourced 
Jekyll setup developed by Mark Otto. It can be found on GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/poole/poole).
