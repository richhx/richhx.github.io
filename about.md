>Hi. I'm Richard, a normal guy who does normal things.

I graduated from Los Gatos High School in 2014 and am currently studying 
Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I am a 
student, writer, "baller", coder, and am passionate about learning and 
creating stuff. There are many things I want to do, but in the end, I 
want to make a difference in this world for the betterment of others 
through education and technology. But that's in the long run. For now, 
I'm studying and will be using this website to discuss my thoughts and 
ideas. Feel free to contact me and check me out on my website, GitHub 
and beyond.
