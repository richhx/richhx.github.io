>Hi. I'm Richard, a normal guy who does normal things.

I graduated from Los Gatos High School in 2014 and am currently pursuing
a B.S. Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.
I will be using this website to discuss my ideas and thoughts and post my
ongoing projects. Feel free to check me out on Github and beyond.

`git checkout richardhuang`
