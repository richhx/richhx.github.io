>Hi. I'm Richard, a normal guy who does normal things.

I graduated from Los Gatos High School in 2014 and am currently attending
the University of California, San Diego pursuing a B.S. Computer Science.
I will be using this website to potentially write about my thoughts and
ideas in a blog, host my resume, and post my ongoing projects. Feel free
to check me out on GitHub and beyond.
