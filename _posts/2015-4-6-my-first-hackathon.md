I just came back from LAHacks and it was an exhausting but worthwhile experience. 
This was my first hackathon that I have ever attended and the amount of energy, 
enthusiasm, and dedication that I saw at the event was incredible. If you do not 
know what a hackathon is, it is a coding competition in which “hackers” have an 
allotted time – LAHacks had 36 hours – to create something awesome. I met countless 
hackers, great public speakers and many people that have the potential to innovate 
and create amazing products. For example, some of the products people made at the
time were a “Mind-Controlled Mercedes”, a robot that mimicked a person’s movement, 
and an application that saved money on Amazon purchases. These products were not 
completely perfect such as the mind-controlled Mercedes could only handle turning
left and right and many more did not really have any practical usage, but these 
products demonstrate how people can do amazing things in just a small amount of 
time. You don’t need a strong background in computer science and engineering to 
build something. You just need a good idea and people willing to create and have fun. <br>

Despite all the innovation and enthusiasm I saw, I also noticed the converse. 
There were many people who I saw who only came for the free products and the ride
to Los Angeles. Many others also played video games such as the ever popular video 
game League of Legends during the time and did not really do anything else. These 
individuals did not contribute to the environment of the hackathon, but they did 
have a good time I suppose doing what they enjoyed. I do not judge these individuals 
for their actions, and I should applaud them for taking advantage of an opportunity 
available to them and making it work for the betterment of themselves. <br>

However, I hope they do realize that they took a great opportunity from somebody else 
who would benefit from such an experience. Some of my friends who would have put in 
hours of dedication and enthusiasm and would have loved the experience did not get 
accepted. These people themselves also missed out the experience. Hackathons are a 
great social and learning environment for those who put in the effort. Cliché as it is, 
you get out as much as you put into such an event. I am interested in Android programming 
and my group and I created an application that is similar to Tinder except it is to find 
a gym buddy. I learned a lot through the process about Parse databases and more about 
Android programming, and this showed me that experience is just as good of a learning
process, if not better, than learning in school. The application still has a lot of work 
to do, but we plan on publishing it to the Google Play Store once it is functioning. If
you would like to look at it, you can always contact me or just check it out on GitHub. <br> 

I loved the event despite the exhaustion and frustration. It was an extremely tiring and 
time-consuming experience, but it is something that I believe all programmers should 
experience at least once. Don’t be daunted by the fact that you have a time limit or 
anything else. The time is actually a lot and the fatigue is easy enough to overcome 
though the social environment and encouragement of others. A hackathon offers the 
motivation and stimulation of ideas that are important for society to progress, and I 
congratulate those who won. They made great products and are the sort of people that will 
make a difference in innovation. Hackathons are really fun, but despite all that I have 
said, you don’t need a hackathon to get started. Just do what you enjoy, and don’t let 
anything stop you.
