During Fall Quarter of my freshman year in college, I took a seminar called Facebook America led
by Professor Rahimi Babarak. The seminar was surprisingly enlightening, seeing how social media
permeates our lives. We discussed various films, talked about our opinions on social media,
and performed our own social experiments; these activities illuminated some of the effects of 
social media on our lives and the relationship between humans and technology today especially
in regards to Facebook. <br>

Almost everybody nowaday has a Facebook or uses some form of social media such as Twitter, Instagram,
Yik Yak, Linkedin, etc. There are many benefits to having all of these social media accounts: it keeps us
engaged, connected, and interacted. Social media has allowed information to spread at unbelievable speeds 
and let us find and make friends we never could have before. Groups, pages, and followers 
have accumulated over the years, and our social networks have allowed us to conveniently discover opportunities. 
We can talk to people across the world and view everything that occurs around us from leagues away. 
It has kept media networks and public figures easily accountable for what they say, as once it is out in the Internet, 
it is out there to stay. Social media is rather fun and has a lot to it.

As our social media becomes ever more ubiquitous though, just like any revolutionary movement, social media 
has also had its backlash. There have been various instances of cyber-bullying, and although that is a 
major problem, one of the things I have noticed with Facebook especially are the narcissistic attitudes of 
people to create the perfect image of themself. People spend a lot of their time on Facebook in an
attempt to create a picture perfect image of themself. Along with this comes people "stalking" other 
people's lives to see their perfect images. I have perceived unfavorable reactions from this: 
ambivalence, jealousy, and distress. Some people don't care about others' posts on Facebook as they 
only connect with people who they actually consider true friends. It just fills up some of their space 
on their wall and wastes their time. Others notice how much fun other people are having and become jealous, 
wanting to one-up them in whatever way possible. I also see a lot of people become distressed that their 
friends are having the best times of their lives while these people just sit at home trying to get by, 
thinking about how they were not invited, or about how much work they have to do. Facebook and Instagram 
have become the highlight reels of our lives, open to the public and for everyone to see, and this openness 
has caused many mixed reactions.

But is there anything actually wrong with this? I say not really. In reality, most people enjoy it, 
and although you may look weird to always have your phone out taking selfies and recording every 
moment of your life, there is certainly nothing wrong with this self-indulgence and self-promotion 
except a little bit of an ego. Facebook provides a way for people to publicize their events, their 
clubs, fraternities, and activities. It is interesting to see what other people are doing and is nice 
to see all the opportunities available. For those that become distressed or jealous, you
just need to remember that what people post online is the best (and worst) parts of their lives. There 
is no need to outdo a friend online or become distressed about something not even remotely part of 
your life.

Nevertheless, I do agree that this narcisstic attitude has its downfalls and stress that there is importance 
in disconnecting once in a while to get away from all of this. Social media has almost become unsocial. 
We constantly look at our phones, posts on Facebook, tweets on Twitter, and updates from our friends who
try to portray themselves as having the best time ever with a life full of excitement. True human 
interaction has diminished as people try to create a perfect picture of their life for others to see, 
photographing their friends, food, and events. Although, I enjoy seeing the amazing activities that people 
partake in as this strives me to become more active, what I'm saying is, don't become infatuated about always 
showing others what you are doing. Enjoy your right to privacy and just relax sometimes. Disconnecting from
technology and just embracing the moment often provides a better experience than attempting to record it
through your smartphone's camera.

In the end, I see social media as one of the greatest things that could have happened. It has
changed the nature of how we communicate and keep in touch, making communication extremely convenient. 
It has allowed people to express their thoughts and feelings, receive updates from people they 
like, and most importantly establish a group of people one feels comfortable with. Humans are inherently 
social beings. There is no denying that as that is the way society has been built. Facebook and various 
other media networks have allowed us to build this social aspect in us and foster it with a large user base.
As technology and social media becomes ever more omnipresent in our lives, it is still important to not let
it overwhelm us and our individuality. It is easy to get stuck in the flood and hype of the latest technology
and fads, and this often has detrimental consequences when uncontrolled. 

So TLDR (too long didn't read): enjoy social media and its benefits but don't obsess over it. Enjoy the present; there's a
lot to it.
