During Fall Quarter of my freshman year in college, I took a seminar called Facebook America taught
by Professor Rahimi Babarak. The seminar was surprisingly enlightening seeing as how social media
permeates our lifestyles and technology, and the seminar illuminated some relations between humans
and technology today. <br>

Almost everybody nowaday has a Facebook and uses many more social networks such as Twitter, Instagram,
Yik Yak, etc. There's many benefits to having all of these social media accounts: it keeps people
engaged, connected, and promotes interactions between people across the world. Social media has allowed
information to spread at unbelievable speeds and allows people to find and make friends they never could
have before.

Nevertheless, as it becomes ever more ubiquitous, like the initial backlash to technology, social media has 
its issues.

*IN PROGRESS - Probably should have made a branch...*
