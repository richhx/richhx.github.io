During Fall Quarter of my freshman year in college, I took a seminar called Facebook America taught
by Professor Rahimi Babarak. The seminar was surprisingly enlightening seeing as how social media
permeates our lifestyles and technology, and the seminar illuminated some relations between humans
and technology today. <br>

Almost everybody nowaday has a Facebook and many more social media accounts like Twitter, Instagram,
Yik Yak, etc. There's many benefits to having all of these social media accounts: it keeps people
engaged, connected, and promotes interactions between people across the world. 

*IN PROGRESS - Probably should have made a branch...*
