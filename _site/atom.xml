  &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/KKhHpkn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Millenial-Generation&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entitled generation grows at this very moment. I myself am a part of this generation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been told I’m a smart guy. I can easily understand material, get straight A’s, and do the work I am told to do, 
but I’m really not all that bright. Almost everything has been spoon-fed to me and the same goes for many others. Schools have
made it so that it is almost too easy to “learn”: memorize some ideas, vocabulary, or whatever the teacher wants and then just
barf it all out for a test. It’s formulaic and works to a certain extent, but I wouldn’t say it is truly learning. Learning is
understanding, but currently an “intellectual hide and seek” occurs where students look for what the teacher wants them to 
say. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t expect everything to be handed to you on a silver platter, and I have recently realized this. My dad nagged me about
having the potential to do what I thought I never could do. He told me go out there with an idea, some thought, and a purpose.
I thought that stuff was meant for “adults” and “grown-ups”, those who actually had professional skills. I told myself that I 
didn’t have the time when I certainly did. I was rather lacking the motivation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now see what my dad was (and still is) talking about. I have all the resources I need and so do you. We are incredibly lucky 
to have what we have today: Google, the Internet, global communication, and this is all thanks to the extraordinary advancements 
in technology. The limit to one’s learning and education is what one desires, not just what is taught in school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have told myself and I tell you, you can do it, easily and comprehensively. Learn an instrument, new languages, 
how to code. Learn what you have always wanted to. The resources are all readily available in the digital age of information 
we currently live in. You don’t have to go to college or limit yourself to what you are currently doing. It takes up a lot of
time, but that’s just an excuse for many people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, an uneducated nineteen-year-old undergraduate. It’ll be worth it in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some places that I have found extremely helpful in my search for knowledge, specifically programming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I’m serious. This is the best place to start. Type in what you desire and Google will find it.
Wikipedia and YouTube are just as good too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
These are actual college courses and are not to be taken lightly. They offer so much information and best of all?
It’s free. It truly makes me question why I’m going to college. College is an experience in and of itself though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
Codecademy teaches the basics of computer programming in a fun and interactive environment. It makes it simple to 
start learning a new language or area and you can see results immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/training/index.html&quot;&gt;Android Programming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This is what I’m doing right now, and it’s certainly an exciting experience to see your own app appear on a smartphone.
I’m incredibly lucky to have the wealth to own one and I do not intend to let it go to waste. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more resources out there. You just have to look. The only thing stopping you is yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
